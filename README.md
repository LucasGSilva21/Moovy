## 💻 Description

Moovy is a mobile and web app where a movie enthusiast can search for his favorite
movies and record audio reviews. The user can manage a list called “My Library” where he/she
can save his previously watched movies. After saving them in the library, the user can upload
an audio file review for that movie.

All “My library” management functions are on the web application. The mobile application
is passive to the changes done there.

The mobile application will only have 1 basic feature: Audio review management. These
reviews will be done to the present movies on the “My Library” list, managed in the web
application.
